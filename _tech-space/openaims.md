#### The Growing Trends in AI
------------------------

Modern Artificial Intelligence is relatively new. It is only from the early 2000, did the progress start to gain momentum. This is primarily because of two things, the availability of high compute processors and the proliferation of data (thanks to the Internet). These two factors were the major bottlenecks during the so called, "AI Winter" [1]. However, in retrospect, the advancement of AI in a mere 20-year duration is indeed something to be impressed about.

In my opinion there is a third factor which contributed to this -- the open source community. When you want to advance on something revolutionary, it makes no sense to walk alone. In the case of AI, the research community decided to grow together. They shared their researches which allowed people from different walks and skillsets to contribute to its development. Fast-forward 20 years, AI has unmistakably become a part of our everyday life transforming a variety of fields. Over the last few years, what started as a combined effort in advancing technology has now become a lucrative race to find who owns this market.

#### OpenAI and GPT-3
----------------

OpenAI is one of the most pioneering AI research and deployment company of today along with Alphabet's DeepMind. It was co-founded by Elon Musk [2], though he resigned from the board after a possible conflict of interest. Perhaps you have tried their [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) [3]. Their recent innovatory work is their auto-regressive language model family -- Generative Pre-trained Transformer. The family iterated from GPT to GPT-2 to the newest GPT-3. GPT-3 is the world's largest language model. To get a sense of what the GPT-3 model is capable of, imagine an overly smart auto-fill feature capable of writing a whole story on its own from a single line or writing a song or a poem from a subject, generating a script for a website based on a description and so on. To know more, this is an interesting site: <https://gpt3examples.com/>.  The power of the algorithm can be attributed to the shear volume of data it was trained on. GPT-3 has an astounding 175 Billion parameters [4]. It is estimated that, the whole of English Wikipedia attributes to just 0.6 percent of the training data [5]. To know more about the GPT-3, you can checkout this arXiv paper : <https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165>.

#### OpenAI and Microsoft
--------------------

This powerful model now belongs to the tech-giant Microsoft. OpenAI is giving the exclusive rights of the most powerful GPT-3 to Microsoft for 1 Billion USD. This means that only Microsoft can access the underlying source code of GPT-3 and modify it as they seem fit for any purpose they require. What started off as a non-profit company, with the promise of developing AI products and researches that benefits "all humanity" is now starting to waver from its promise. This is not the first instance of moving away from its promise. In 2019, OpenAI stopped its release of GPT-2 which already signalled the possibility of it moving from non-profit to profit oriented business model. The possibility became a fact when it opened the for-profit corporation OpenAI LP. Now, with the GPT-3's exclusive rights belonging to Microsoft, it is starting to raise concerns about the future of the AI industry.

#### Two sides of the coin
---------------------

From the view of OpenAI, to get better results, the advance AI algorithms of today require far more compute power and storage capabilities which are only affordable by giants such as Microsoft and Google. This merger could mean that there is a good chance to speed-up Humanity's attempt in creating incredibly powerful AI models that can revolutionize our world and solve some of the pressing problems of today. However, there are also reasonably pressing concerns about the monopoly of the AI research. With AI models generating fake-contents indistinguishable from the real-ones, the ethical concern of using such a model by a profit-based company is indeed scary. Either way, the coin has been tossed. It is indeed an interesting era to be a part of.
