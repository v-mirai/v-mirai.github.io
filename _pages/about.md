**About me**

I am Venkat and welcome to my blog, "VeeSpace". I like to code. I am a Python and C++ programmer by trade, with a special interest on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Science. I just completed my Masters and I intend to work on applied AI (or maybe a PhD?).

 Previously I worked at Robert Bosch Engineering and Business Solutions for 3 years as a communication network software developer for the active safety ECUs. After 3 years of industrial learning and an organizational atmosphere, I finally decided to get back to studying (and some travelling). I came to Germany during the winter of 2017 to pursue my Master of Science in Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences.

I studied quite some interesting topics of which one really reeled me in - AI. I was so fascinated by the concept of teaching a computer to learn! So I dove in and started studying the fundamentals, doing voluntary projects, internships, certifications and ended-up even writing my Master Thesis in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning. After 3 years of exploring data science and AI, I still feel there is a lot to ponder.

**About this site**

Making a personal website was on my mind for quite some time now. I finally found time to do it. I decided to call it 'VeeSpace' because of no special reason. It was the name that came to me when I wanted a personal space to reflect on the world through my head.

Broadly, this site is divided into two sub-spaces: Tech-Space and Blog-Space.

            **Tech-Space:** My technical experiences that I would like to share.

            **Blog-Space:** My personal experiences that I would like to share.

If you have any question or comment or suggestion, you can always mail me.
