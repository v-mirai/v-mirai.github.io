Hey Guys... How's it going?
I am Venkat and this is my blog, "VeeSpace". I like to code. I am a Python and C++ programmer with a special interest on Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. I just completed my Masters and I intend to pursue a research oriented work (maybe a PhD?) on applied AI.
 Previously I worked at Robert Bosch Engineering and Business Solutions for 3 years as a communication network software developer for the active safety ECUs. After 3 years of industrial learning and an organizational atmosphere, I finally decided to get back to studying (and some travelling). I came to Germany during the winter of 2017 to pursue my Master of Science in Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences. I studied quite some interesting topics of which one really reeled me in - AI. I was so fascinated by the concept of teaching a computer to learn! I was determined to quench this thirst and started studying the fundementals, doing voluntary projects, internships, certifications and ended-up even writing my Master Thesis in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning. After 3 years of exploring data science and AI, I still feel there is a lot to ponder. Hence I decided to coninue my quest to learn more about AI and build cool projects out of that knowledge. I am excited to find out where this path will take me! 

Apart from that I like to eat spicy chicken, read novels, comics, watch movies, make-up stories and I believe in Aliens.

Cheers!
